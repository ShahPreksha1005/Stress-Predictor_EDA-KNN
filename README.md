# StressPredictor_EDA-KNN
An analytical project focused on exploring relationships between stress levels and environmental/behavioral factors (humidity, temperature, and step count) using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and classification through K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Project Overview
This project investigates the correlation between stress levels and features such as humidity, temperature, and step count. By analyzing data distributions and relationships, we gain insights into how these factors might influence stress levels. The EDA includes histogram and boxplot visualizations, and a KNN model is applied to classify stress levels based on feature values.

## Key Components
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Examines the uniform or discretized distributions of humidity, temperature, and step count.
   - Visualizations (histograms and boxplots) reveal the relationship between these features and stress levels.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification**: 
   - Used to predict stress levels based on the identified patterns in the data.
   - Provides a performance evaluation to measure classification accuracy across stress categories.

## Inferences
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms reveal that humidity, temperature, and step count are uniformly distributed, indicating consistent patterns across value ranges.
- **Relationship Analysis**: Boxplots show how each featureâ€™s distribution varies with stress levels, suggesting potential correlations.

## Conclusion
The findings from this analysis provide a foundation for understanding the environmental and behavioral factors associated with stress. The use of EDA and KNN aids in creating a predictive framework for stress classification.

## Future Enhancements
- Consider exploring more advanced modeling techniques for improved classification accuracy.
- Expand the analysis with additional environmental or behavioral features for broader insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
